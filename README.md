Pygame Features

This is my first pygame ever. I really enjoyed writing this pygame.
I hope really it work and shows what had been asked.
I tried my best to make this pygame best.

My Chimp pygame is improved by adding the following features:

Make screen bigger - giving the game much better view
Make monkey move around the outter edges of the window
Keep score (hits and misses) and display on the screen cleanly and clearly - your design
Allow user to pause the game - this feature has a pause button
Give user menu option to select various levels
Add 2 of your favorite other animals (other than chimp); Create or find an image of similar size to the chimp.
Add background music, be sure to pause it when the user pauses the game.
My own new feature: Is that the bananas falling from sky and few monkeys catching them.
