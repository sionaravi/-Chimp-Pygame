# -Chimp-Pygame
Pygame Features

This is my first pygame ever. I really enjoyed writing this pygame.
I hope really it work and shows what had been asked.
I tried my best to make this pygame best.

My Chimp pygame is improved by adding the following features:

1. Make screen bigger - giving the game much better view

2. Make monkey move around the outter edges of the window

3. Keep score (hits and misses) and display on the screen cleanly and clearly - your design

4. Allow user to pause the game - this feature has a pause button

5. Give user menu option to select various levels

6. Add 2 of your favorite other animals (other than chimp); Create or find an image of similar size to the chimp.

7. Add background music, be sure to pause it when the user pauses the game.

8. My own new feature: Is that the bananas falling from sky and few monkeys catching them.
